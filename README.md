* We define a *script hunter* by someone who is always looking for the right
  script or the right piece of code to build non-sophisticated and/or sophisticated 
  softwares during a short period of time. 

  However, even if you're a beginner at programming, you might be considered as a 
  *script hunter* as long as you know how to write basic programs other programmers 
  can read easily to find out the process behind your script.
  
  _That's it ! You hunt for the right script to build your software and you share your own prey._
